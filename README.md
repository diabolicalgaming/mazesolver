# mazesolver
I developed a program that allows a person to generate a maze of a range of sizes and then using a robot, 
the program graphically demonstrates a path to solve the maze. The main idea of this project revolves around 
various path finding algorithms, such as BFS, DFS, Greedy, A*, and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. The purpose is to 
visualize how these algorithms work internally to provide a better understanding for anyone who has difficulty
grasping the various algorithms. This was developed using Java.
